    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
      In just one year, I lost <span class="highlight">120 pounds</span> — but more importantly, I gained clarity, confidence, and control over my life.
      This wasn't a quick fix or a crash diet. It was a commitment to doing things the right way: with <span class="highlight">discipline</span>, <span class="highlight">consistency</span>, and a <span class="highlight">proven process</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a father who had let things slip — not because I didn’t care, but because life got heavy in more ways than one. Like many men, I poured everything into work and family, and forgot about myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This journey was about more than just weight. It was about becoming the man my family needs — strong, focused, present. If you’re a man, a father, and you feel like you’ve lost control, I want you to know: it’s not too late.
    </p>

    <h2>For Men & Fathers</h2>
    <p>
      You don’t need a six-pack. You need strength, health, and energy to lead your family — and show up as your best self.
    </p>
    <p>
      I built a system that works for busy lives. No gimmicks. No shame. Just tools that help you build discipline and stay consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is for men ready to take responsibility — not just for their body, but for their life.
